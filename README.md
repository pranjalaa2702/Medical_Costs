Medical Insurance Costs Predictor

🚀 Developed a machine learning model to estimate medical insurance costs using key demographic and health factors.

Input Features: Age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

Output: Predicted medical insurance charges based on historical data trends.

🔗 Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning techniques to identify cost-driving factors and make accurate predictions.

🚀 Advantages: The model helps understand how lifestyle choices and demographics impact insurance costs, providing insights for both individuals and insurance companies.

📚 Training: The model is trained on a labeled dataset where actual insurance charges are known, improving predictive accuracy.

🛠️ Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

💡 How to Use:

Open Medical_Insurance_Costs.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells sequentially to explore and analyze the data.

Modify parameters or try different models to improve predictions.

⚡ Installation:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

📌 Key Insights:

Smoking and high BMI significantly increase insurance costs.

Age and number of children also influence charges but to a lesser extent.

The model can be further improved by incorporating additional features like medical history.
